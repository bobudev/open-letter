# An Open Letter to the Bobus It May Concern

Yo Bobu, :wave:

It's me, Bobu. I'm writing this letter to throw my lantern into the ring for ~~CTO of Bobu~~ [part-time Jr. Full Stack Developer](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSc42Z27328oMuo4LBGVGPUk1p3YFpFw8-lFXs6ji3WfpjO2vQ/viewform) position.

I hope to convince you through this letter that I'm the right Bobu for the job and maybe teach you something new about Bobu.

## What I've Done

I spent weeks reviewing everything about Bobu. I believe the ideal candidate should be able to explain who Bobu is, know past proposals, and understand the current situation, so I went ahead and gathered that information.

I also responded to the job listing's question in a section titled "[What do you believe you can contribute to the Bobu Experiment?](#what-i-believe-i-can-contribute-to-the-bobu-experiment)"

Lastly, I included some [relevant work](#relevant-work).

## Who is Bobu?

Bobu is a character from [Azuki](https://www.azuki.com/), an NFT collection by [Chiru Labs](https://www.chirulabs.com/) consisting of 10,000 unique NFTs. Bobu, specifically [Azuki #40](https://www.azuki.com/gallery?id=40), was exchanged for 50,000 newly created [Bobu NFTs](https://magiceden.io/collections/ethereum/bobutoken?status=%22magic_eden%22) in a Web3 experiment to explore governance through token holders.

> "... all holders of Bobu Tokens in the community can participate in collective governance over Bobu's character, a key character in the Azuki universe."
>
> ―[Bobu 101](https://bobu.azuki.com/bobu-101)

Simply put, Bobu is:

1. A character in the Azuki universe
2. Governed by token holders through proposals

Proposals can be on anything related to Bobu. The current proposal process involves:

1. Token holders drafting proposals with the committee
2. Committee members and stakeholders spreading awareness through X[^1]
3. Token holders voting on proposals via [Snapshot](https://snapshot.org/#/bobuthefarmer.eth)
4. Initiating work on approved proposals

[^1]: Formerly known as Twitter.

## Proposals

As of **June 20th, 2024**, we've had 14 proposals.

> [!NOTE]
> The [Proposals](https://bobu.azuki.com/proposals) page has two errors:
>
> - A governance update is mislabeled as the 4th proposal
> - The "Bobu Twitter Banner" proposal is missing

Here's what we've accomplished so far:

- Create merchandise (1, 4, 6, 9)
- Send Bobu to space and do social good (2)
- Make art (3, 6, 10, 11)
- Explore technology and collaborate with Web3 brands (12, 13, 14)

## The current situation

Issues we are facing:

1. Governance is difficult to manage (7, 13)
2. Increasing holder participation (13)

Other issues I see:

1. Content on the website is outdated
2. Not enough lore to build off of
3. Inconsistencies and other minor issues

## What I believe I can contribute to the Bobu Experiment

I've rewritten this section several times before I realized that the most effective way to communicate what I can contribute is to simply make a hypothetical TODO list.

- [ ] Request Chiru Labs and the committee to realign with the original goal of developing the character
- [ ] Fix errors on the [Proposals](https://bobu.azuki.com/proposals) page ([see note in Proposals section](#proposals))
- [ ] Fix typos in [Po-Lore-oid](https://bobu.azuki.com/po-lore-oid) page
  - [ ] "Yuki" should be "Azuki #147 (Yuki)"
  - [ ] "Beanz 4257" should be "Bean #4257
  - [ ] ...
- [ ] Fix the nav on screen widths 1024px-1224px
- [ ] Request Chiru Labs to produce missing pixel art for proposals 7-14 or request to have them removed as it looks inconsistent
- [ ] Request the committee to review the content for [Home](https://bobu.azuki.com/), [Bobu 101](https://bobu.azuki.com/bobu-101), and [Governance](https://bobu.azuki.com/governance) page as they are outdated
- [ ] Archive less relevant pages:
  - [ ] [Mint](https://bobu.azuki.com/mint)
  - [ ] [Bobu's Beans Bucket](https://bobu.azuki.com/buckethat)
  - [ ] ...
- [ ] Create a page similar to Azuki's [About](https://azuki.com/about) page to showcase what we've already accomplished
- [ ] Learn each detail of the proposal process
- [ ] Rework the proposal process
- [ ] Create a brand page
- [ ] Add data to the [Proposals](https://bobu.azuki.com/proposals) page
  - How much money does the treasury have?
  - How much money and time was spent on a proposal?
  - What is the current status of each proposal?

### Reasoning

There are four main types of users that need to be served:

1. Anyone that wants to learn about Bobu's story
2. Prospective token holders
3. Token holders that want to learn about a proposal
4. Token holders looking to create a proposal

Bobu's story is fragmented and that makes it difficult to develop his character. Is Bobu a mononym? Does he have family? How old is he? What does he like or dislike? Why should anyone care about Bobu if the only things they know about him is that he's a bean farmer that likes sake?

</details>

Po-Lore-oid was a step in the right direction, but we still lack basic story elements to build on. People need a reason to care. The situation may have been different if Bobu was a cat. Characters like Sanrio's Hello Kitty can become popular just by being cute. I'm making an assumption here, but I don't think there is a market for drunk bean farmers (yet).

Anyway, making Bobu's story more coherent is crucial for advancing the experiment. This requires realigning Chiru Labs, the committee, and token holders. In the meantime, the site should be updated and optimized for clarity and proposals.

Some examples of improvements:

- The Home page should clearly explain the Bobu Experiment in three sentences or fewer, with a call-to-action to learn more.
- The rest of the Home page should briefly describe the proposal drafting process and highlight accomplishments.
- Create documentation detailing the best methods to acquire tokens, vote, and submit proposals.
- A FAQ page with a form can save the committee time by reducing repetitive inquiries.
- Currently, we use the main site, Ghost CMS, Snapshot, and Notion. Ideally, we should use Snapshot's API so users can vote without leaving the site and stick to just Notion or just Ghost CMS, not both. It's possible to statically generate the site with Notion.

Other ideas:

- "So you want to make a proposal?"
  - Image: Smug Bobu or Bobu on one knee with a ring
  - Primer on the proposal drafting process
- "How to run a ~~Champagne~~ campaign"
  - Image: Bobu drunk with Champagne
  - Explains the best strategies to spread awareness
  - Thread template
  - Link to brand page
  - Example of successful campaigns
- "Proof of Bobu's Work (PoBW)"
  - About page showcasing successful proposals
    -...

I acknowledge that these tasks exceed the scope of a part-time position. My intention is to attend meetings, [provide guidance on technical matters](#web-consultancy) to proposal drafters, the committee, or Chiru Labs, and, with permission, work on these issues. I will write tickets if I lack collaborator access to the repositories or might prepare my own proposals. While I'm unsure if it's possible to work on all these issues, I want to express my willingness to.

## Relevant work

### Web Consultancy

I had a brief stint as a consultant for businesses trying to use the web more effectively. I learned many tough lessons from my own businesses that I shared with clients.

- Always set domains on autorenewal
- Stick with the stack that you're most productive with
- Tools like Shopify often can do the job fine
- Use password managers and 2FA

I don't have experience with running ads although I have friends that do. I'm in the camp of making good products and focusing on content marketing. I keep track of recent trends and know about most offerings like [Resend](https://resend.com/), [Webflow](https://webflow.com/), and even some more obscure ones like [GitButler](https://gitbutler.com/) although almost all the clients I worked with never needed anything more sophisticated than a static site, headless CMS, and a form (or Shopify for the ecommerce businesses).

### Bobu Countdown ([Demo](https://bobu-three.vercel.app/) | [Repo](https://github.com/bobudev/countdown)) [^2]

This app was made coincidentally after a conversation with Bobu Chancellor, Pretzel. He was looking for a timer to use for the upcoming BoFi (Bobu Lo-fi) launch. I offered to make one after seeing that the timers he found didn't look great.

He had a GIF and a dream, so I had to use the Bobu website to get the fonts, colors, and other visual elements.

The most difficult task was reverse engineering the canvas firefly effect. After I found the relevant minified JS, I asked ChatGPT to add sensible variable and function names, and then I had it explain line by line what the code was doing.

After about two hours I had something that worked. I wanted to make the timer start at an editable time, but Pretzel said he was sure he wasn't going to accidentally close the window in the 24 hour window before launch.

Thankfully, launch went without a hitch.

[^2]: I added a favicon and page title the other day, but unfortunately, Vercel won't let me create a new account without a different phone number. The [Demo](https://bobu-three.vercel.app/) is the one used for launch while the [Repo](https://github.com/bobudev/countdown) is the version with the few changes including some TODOs in the `README.md` if I were to ever revisit it.

### Whispers of Taiji

This project is in development. It uses an Azuki Elementals license. Information about it is sensitive, but I have received permission to share it if we were to have a call.

## Conclusion

Did you read all that, Bobu?

I didn't think so. Here's the tl;dr:

- There are errors on the website
- We need to get Bobu's story going
- We should make the site more intuitive

I can help. gib job.
